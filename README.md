# test-task

## The first part of the text-task is a console application and a library that can calculate the area of a circle by radius and a triangle by three sides.

### The following factors were also taken into account when performing the task:
+ Each figure is added by creating a class that extends the abstract Figure class.

+ The area is calculated by determining the number of numbers from the input string (if these are three numbers, then this is a triangle, and if one, then a circle).

+ Checking whether a triangle is right-angled occurs through the Pythagorean theorem.

## The second part of the text-task is SQL-query to select all Product Name - Category Name pairs.
sql-query/sql query.txt contains:
+ database creation
+ data insertion
+ data fetch request
